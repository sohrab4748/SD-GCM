What is the SD GCM software?
The SD GCM (<a href="https://agrimetsoft.com/sd-gcm" target="_blank">Statistical Downscaling</a> of General Circulation Models) represents a valuable software package tailored to the requirements of researchers and users in need of an efficient tool for employing statistical downscaling methods. Particularly adept at downscaling CMIP5 models predicated on Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) Scenarios, this software serves as an indispensable asset.

Embedded within the SD GCM tool are multiple statistical downscaling (SD) methods. Notably, three prominent statistical downscaling models are at users' disposal:

- The Delta method
- The <a href="https://agrimetsoft.com/sd-gcm" target="_blank">Quantile Mapping</a> (QM) method (Panofsky and Briar, 1968)
- The <a href="https://agrimetsoft.com/sd-gcm" target="_blank">Empirical Quantile Mapping</a> (EQM) method (Boe et al., 2007)

These methodologies empower users to conduct precise downscaling of climate data, thereby facilitating comprehensive analysis and exploration of diverse climate scenarios. The SD GCM tool emerges as an invaluable resource for climate researchers and users alike, offering precise statistical downscaling capabilities.
